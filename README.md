# Blindspot

Blindspot is a web app that scans global streaming catalogues and real‑time demand signals to spot the “white spaces” your
content hasn’t reached yet. In seconds, it ranks regions with the highest upside, reveals exactly which titles
competitors host there, and projects the ROI of expanding or localising each show—all powered by a blend of live APIs,
static market data, and AI optimisation. Put simply: Blindspot turns guesswork into data‑backed expansion plans, so
executives can green‑light their next billion‑viewer market before anyone else sees it.
